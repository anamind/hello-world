# hello-world


So this is me!!

I'm here to try out coding. Maybe someday I can use it in my work and maybe 
make myself more attractive when it comes to workoptions.
First and foremost let me introduse myself. My name is Ana and I hope to
learn more about coding as time progresses forward.
Coding really is fun and I really want to learn more and as I have seen 
and read so far there is a lot to learn and you never seem to stop learning and
that is perfect for me because this is really exciting.
I'm currently between jobs so I thought that now is the time to learn something
that I can use when I'm out looking for jobs.
And I hope someday that I get my dreamjob that is working with coding and put up
beautiful webpages and so forth.
